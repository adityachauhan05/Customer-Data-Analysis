ðŸ“Š Insights:

- The highest ARPU is from William Morris (Brasil) with $2024.96, showing extremely strong spending behavior.
- Older customers (50+ age group like Kristi Bender, Michael Fisher, and Alexander Smith) show consistently higher ARPU compared to younger customers (16â€“25), suggesting mature customers spend more.
- China has 4 out of the top 10 users by ARPU, indicating it is a critical market to nurture.
- Younger users (16â€“21, e.g., William Morris, James Clark, Philip Green, Paul Santana) also appear in the top ARPU list, highlighting potential for long-term lifetime value if retained.
- The revenue distribution is skewed â€” a few users contribute disproportionately high ARPU, meaning customer concentration risk exists.
- Female customers (Kristi Bender, Stacy Peck, Brianna Weaver, Jessica Jones, Mary Mason) are strongly represented in the top ARPU list, indicating gender-based targeting could be effective.
- Targeting campaigns should focus on **high ARPU clusters**: (1) Young but high-spending individuals, (2) Mature high-income individuals, (3) China & US-based customers.
