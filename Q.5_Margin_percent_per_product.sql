/*
- ‚ùì Business Question:
- Finding the profit margin percent per product highest to lowest?
- Why Important:
- High-margin products contribute more to overall profitability and should be prioritized 
- in marketing, sales focus, and inventory allocation. Low-margin products may require 
- cost optimization, price adjustment, or bundling strategies to stay competitive.

üìä Product Margin Insights:
- Fashion and branded products (Alpha Industries, Levi‚Äôs, Adidas) 
  dominate the high margin_percent category,  
  while electronics/accessories rely on higher selling prices instead of % margin.  

- Products with very low margin_percent (<20%) 
  may require **supplier cost renegotiation or price adjustments**.  

- Both metrics should be tracked together:  
  üîπ profit_margin = absolute money made per unit  
  üîπ margin_percent = pricing efficiency
